# Chapter 2 Measurement
## Measuring GDP
* three approaches:
  1. product approach 
  2. expenditure approach
  3. income approach
* Key concepts:
  1. ***intermediate good*** : a good that is produced and then used as an input to another production process
  2. ***income-expenditure identity*** :
   Y as the aggregate income,and C+I+G+NX as the sum of the components of aggregate expenditure
  $$
   Y=C+I+G+NX
  $$
  

First example:

An island economy where there is a coconut producer, a restaurant, consumers and a government. ***Government collects taxed to provide national defense.*** 

  |Coconut Producer||
  |--------|----|
  |Total Revenue| $20milion|
  |Wages|$5 million|
  |Interest on Loan|$0.5million|
  |Taxes | $1.5million|

  |Restaurant||
  |--------|----|
  |Total Revenue| $30 milion|
  |Cost of Coconuts|$12 million|
  |Wages|$4 million|
  |Taxes | $3 million|

  |Government||
  |-----|-----|
  |Tax Revenue| $ 5.5 million|
  |Wages| $ 5.5 million|

  |Consumers||
  |--|--|
  |Wage Income| $ 14.5million|
  |Interest Income| $0.5 million|
  |Taxes| $1 million|
  |Profits Distributed from Producers| $ 24 million|
### Product Approach
*Product approach*: taken as the following two steps
* add the value of all goods and services produced in the economy
* subtract the value of all intermediate goods used in production 

*Analysis using the example*:
* *all goods produced*: coconut producer——$ 20 million, restaurant——$ 30 million, govenment——$ 5.5 million.
* *intermediate goods*: 12 million
* 
$$
GDP=20+30+5.5-12=43.5
$$

### Expenditure Approach
*Expenditure Approach*: calculate GDP as total spending on all final goods and services production in the economy.
***attention:don't count spending on intermediate goods***

$$
Total \quad expenditure=C+I+G+NX
$$

* C : expenditure on consumption
* I : investment expenditure
* G : government expenditure
* NX : net exports ***(total exports of goods and services minus total imports)***

In this example:

C-$ 8 million on coconuts and $ 30 million at the restaurant 
$\Rightarrow$
C=$ 38 million

I=0,G=$5.5 million $\Rightarrow$ 

$$
GDP=38+5.5=43.5
$$

### Income Approach
***Income approach***:add up all income received by economic agents contributing to production.

Includes:
* profits made by firms
* compensation of employees(wages,salaries and benifits)
* proprietor's income(self-employeed firm owners)
* rental income
* net interest
* depreciation(consumption of fixed capital):represents the value of productive capital that wears out during the period we are considering.

In this example:
1. wage income of consumer: $14.5 million
2. profits of producers after tax: $24 million
3. net interest of consumers: $0.5 million
4. government income: $4.5 million (***we don't count the tax paid by the consumer because it's already contained the "the wage income of consumer"***)

## What GDP Leaves Out
* Does not take into account the income distribution among the population.
* Leaves out all nonmarket activity.
* Underground economy.

## Components of Aggregate Expenditure
* *Consumption*
* *Investment*: the expenditure on goods that are produced during the current period but not consumed during the current period.
  1. *Fixed investment*: production of capital
  2. *inventory investment*: goods that are essentially put into storage.
* *Net Exports*
* *Government expenditure*


## Nominal and Real GDP and Price Indices

### Nominal and Real GDP
* *Nominal GDP*: calculate GDP in a given year by the price of the given year.

* *Real GDP*: calculate GDP using base year prices.

* *$g_i$*: ratio of year 2 to year 1 using year i as the base year.

* *chain-weighting*: chain-weighted ratio of real GDP in year 2 to real GDP in year 1 equals

$$
g_c=\sqrt{g_1 \times g_2}
$$

### Price Level

* *Implicit GDP price deflator:*
  
  $$
  Implicit \quad GDP \quad Price \quad deflator=\frac{Nominal \quad GDP}{Real \quad GDP}\times 100
  $$

  >The result depends on our choice of the base year.
* *Consumer price index (CPI):*
  
  Includes only goods and services that are purchased by consumers.

  $$
  Current \quad year \quad CPI=\frac{Cost \quad of \quad base \quad year \quad quantities \quad at \quad current \quad prices}{Cost \quad of \quad base \quad year \quad quantities \quad at \quad base-year \quad prices}\times 100
  $$

>**Note: CPI tends to be more volatile than the GDP delfator inflation rate** 

## Savings, Wealth, and Capital

* *Private Disposable Income*:
* 
$$
Y^d=Y+NFP+TR+INT-T
$$

> Y-GDP

> NFP- net factor payments from abroad to U.S residents


> TR— transfers from the government to the private sector


> INT- interest on the government debt

> T- taxes

* *private sector saving*:
  What the private sector saves is simply what it has available to spend minus what it consumes

$$
S^P=Y^d-C=Y+NFP+TR+INT-T-C
$$

* *goverment saving*: also the *government surplus*

$$
S^g=T-TR-INT-G
$$

* *nation saving*:
  
$$
S=S^P+S^g=Y+NFP-C-G=GNP-C-G
$$

$$
Y=C+I+G+NX(expenditure \quad approach)
\Rightarrow
$$

$$
S=I+NX+NFP
$$
> Define current account surplus CA=NX+NFP

* *What we get*:
  1. Any domestic savings not absorbed by domestic investment must be shipped outside the country in the form of goods and services
  2. Wealth is accumulated in two ways:
  * through investment I, which is additions to the nation's capital stock.
  * through current account surpluses CA.
  
## Labor Market Measurement
* *unemployment rate*:
  
  $$
  Unemployment \quad rate=\frac{Number \quad unemployed}{Labor \quad force}
  $$

* *participation rate*:

$$
\frac{Labor \quad force}{Total \quad working - age \quad population}
$$

* *Employment/Population ratio*:
  
  $$
  \frac{Total \quad employment}{Total \quad working - age \quad population}
  $$
