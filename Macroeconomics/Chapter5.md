Chapter 5 A Closed-Economy One-Period Macroeconomic Model

## Government

* purchases an **exogenous** amount G of this output with the remainder consumed by the representative consumer

* ***Government budget constraint:***
  $$
  G=T
  $$

  > government purchases equal taxes

## Competitive Equilibrium

* ***Definition:***

  Given market prices, demand is equal to supply in each market in the economy.

* In this model:

  A competitive equilibrium is achieved when given the exogenous variables *G*, *z*, and *K*, the real wage *w* is such that, at that wage, *the quantity of labor the consumer wishes to supply is equal to the quantity of labor the firm wishes to hire*.

With the income-expenditure identity
$$
Y=C+I+G+NX
$$
and in this model, G=NX=0. We get:
$$
Y=C+G
$$

* Why it holds like this?

  The following gives the proof:
  $$
  C=wN^s+\pi-T\\
  \pi=Y-wN^d\\
  N^d=N^s\\
  T=G\\
  \Rightarrow\\
  Y=C+G
  $$



## Optimality

* ***Pareto optimality***:

  *A competitive equilibrium is* **Pareto optimal** *if there is no way to rearrange production or to reallocate goods so that someone is made better off without making someone else worse off*

  For this model, the competitve equilibrium is identical to the Pareto optimum with 
  $$
  MRS_{l,c}=MRT{l,c}=MP_N
  $$

* ***The first fundamental theorem of welfare economics***:

  *under certain conditions, a competitive equilibrium is Pareto optimal.*

* ***The second fundamental theorem of welfare economics***:

  *under certain conditions, a Pareto optimum is a competitive equilibrium.*

* ***Three reasons that real market economics do not achieve efficiency:***

  1. Negative externalities and positive externalities
  2. Distorting taxes. For example, if imposed on an proportional tax, MRS becomes w(1-t) while MP=MRT=w
  3.  Firms may not be price-takers. 

## Analysis of The Model

*How changes in the **exogenous variables G,z,K** affects the key **endogenous variables C,Y,N,w***



### Change in Government Purchases

* Increasing G:

  * consumption and leisure decreases(because they are normal goods)

  * employment rises and output increases
    $$
    \Delta C=\Delta Y-\Delta G\\
    \Delta Y>0\\
    \Rightarrow \Delta C>-\Delta G
    $$

  * ***real wage:***

    real wage w falls as a result of the increase in government spending.

* ***Is it a likely cause of business cycle?***

  * If fluctuations in government spending are important in causing business cycles, then it should be the case that our model can replicate these key business cycle facts in response to a change in G.
  * The model predicts that, when government spending increases, aggregate output and employment increase, and consumption and the real wage decrease. 
  * One of our key business cycle facts is that employment is procyclical. This fact is consistent with government spending shocks causing business cycles, because employment always moves in the same direction as aggregate output in response to a change in *G*.
  * **Additional business cycle facts are that consumption and the real wage are procyclical, but the model predicts that consumption and the real wage are countercyclical in response to government spending shocks. **

  Therefore, government spending shocks do not appear to be a good candidate as a cause of business cycles. 

### Change in Total Factor Productivity

As we see in this section, increases in total factor productivity increase consumption and aggregate output, but there is an ambiguous effect on employment. This ambiguity is the result of opposing income and substitution effects on labor supply. While an increase in government spending essentially produces only an income effect on consumer behavior, an increase in total factor productivity generates both an income effect and a substitution effect.

Results:

* consumption increases
* output increases
* real wage increases
* leisure may rise or fall(employment is uncertain)

* A->D: substitution effect

* D->B: income effect

* The real wage must increase because 
  $$
  |k_B|>|k_D|>|k_A|
  $$



### Intepretation of the Model's Predictions

* Could fluctuations in total factor productivity be an important cause of business cycle?
  * Three key business cycle facts:
    1. consumption is procyclical
    2. employment is procyclical
    3. real wage is proocyclical
  * For the model to be consistent with the data requires that ***the substitution effect dominate the income effect***.
  * It's possible that total factor productivity shocks could be a primary cause of business cycles.

## A Distorting Tax on Wage Income, Tax Rate Changes, and the Laffer Curve

To keep things simple, we assume
$$
Y=zN^d\\
N^d=h-l,C+G=Y\\
so \quad that \quad PPF:C=z(h-l)-G
$$
Supposing there are no lump-sum taxes, T=0. Then the consumer's budge constraint is:
$$
C=w(1-t)(h-l)+\pi
$$
The maximization problem for the representative firm is:
$$
\pi=Y-wN^d=(z-w)N^d
$$

* Indifferent concerning how much labor to hire if z=w. So that Nd is infinitely elastic at the wage w=z

***Therefore, in equilibrium, the wage must be w=z. So that profits of the firm must be zero***

In equilibrium, the consumer's budget constraint:
$$
\pi=0,w=z\\
\Rightarrow C=z(1-t)(h-l)
$$
Markets clear->
$$
C=z(h-l)-G=z(1-t)(h-l)
$$

* ***Conclusions***:
  1. Pareto optimum , at E, is different from the competitive equilibrium, at H.
  2. consumption and output must be hight and leisure lower at point E than at point H.

### Income Tax Revenue and the Laffer Curve

* Government revenue from tax is 
  $$
  REVENUE=tz[h-l(t)]
  $$

* ***Laffer curve***: denotes any curve that shows the quantity of tax revenue generated by the government as a function of a tax rate.

* In equilibrium, we have
  $$
  G=REVENUE=tz[h-l(t)]
  $$
